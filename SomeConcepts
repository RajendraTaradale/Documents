Singleton

It will be available when its needed in the program. 
You dont need to allocate memory if its not required at the starting time of application. 
class contains both static and non-static members
You can create instance of Singleton class
You can implement inheritance
You can clone a singleton class object
Singleton class object creates in Heap memory

Static 

It will be initialized at the beginning time it self. and it will be available at the program.
Static class contains only static members
You can't create instance of Static class
static you can't implement inheritance
Static class object creates in stack memory.

SuppressFinalize()

SuppressFinalize should only be called by a class that has a finalizer. It's informing the Garbage Collector (GC) that this object was
cleaned up fully

Normally, the CLR keeps tabs on objects with a finalizer when they are created (making them more expensive to create).
SuppressFinalize tells the GC that the object was cleaned up properly and doesn't need to go onto the finalizer queue. 
It looks like a C++ destructor, but doesn't act anything like one.

use of "Delegate" 

When you want to pass the methods as a parameter 
Most important usage of delegate is event handling. Event Handlers are nothing but methods being pointed by delegates and called.
It can also be used in Callbacks 
Asynchronous processing
When developer are not sure what logic is going to pass to complete an event or in method call

What is diff between session storage, local storage and cookies,

localStorage: stores data with no expiration date, and gets cleared only through JavaScript, or clearing the Browser Cache / 
Locally Stored Data

sessionStorage: similar to localStorage but expires when the browser closed (not the tab).

Cookie: stores data that has to be sent back to the server with subsequent requests. Its expiration varies based on the type 
and the expiration duration can be set from either server-side or client-side (normally from server-side).

Absolute Position
An absolute position element is positioned relative to the first parent element that has a position other than static.

Relative Position
A relative positioned element is positioned relative to its normal position.

Process Table

The operating system manages processes by the way of having the process table. For the system, each process is represented as an entry in the process table. Each entry of the given process is often known as process control block (PCB) or process table field. Each entry contains certain pieces of information about a process, and normally includes the following:

Process state: How a process is being executed.
Registers: Program counters (PC) and other sets of registers depending on the CPU architecture.
Scheduling information: Priority, order of queue, and other scheduling parameters.
Memory Management: Amount of allocated memory, etc.
Identification: Process ID, user and group ID's of who owns the process, and permissions.
Input / Output information: List of opened communications to the I/O, such as file descriptors and sockets.

How can you share data between multiple threads?

There are two ways to share data between multiple threads:
Concurrent collection classes
Using Synchronization Primitives

What are Concurrent Collection Classes?
.NET framework class library comes with Concurrent collection classes so that multiple threads can share collection data between them without using synchronization primitives.
 
There are four types of Concurrent classes.
ConcurrentQueue
ConcurrentStack
ConcurrentDictionary
ConcurrentBag

What is synchronization and why it is important?
We use multiple threads to improve the performance of our application. When multiple threads shares data between there is a chance of data corruption. When one thread is writing to the variable another thread is reading the same variable at the same time there is a chance of reading corrupt data.
 
To stop the dirty reads we use synchronization primitives.

Can you count some names of Synchronization primitives?

Monitor
Mutex
SpinLock
ReaderWriterLock
Semaphore
AutoResetEvent
ManualResetEvent
InterLocked
CountDownEvent
Barrier

What is LiveLock?

A livelock is very similar to deadlock except involved threads states are continually changing their state but still they cannot complete their work.

A real-world example of livelock occurs when two people meet in a narrow corridor, and each tries to be polite by moving aside to let the other pass, but they end up swaying from side to side without making any progress because they both repeatedly move the same way at the same time.

What is AutoResetEvent?

AutoResetEvent is a synchronization mechanism which work on a bool variable. If the bool variable is false then thread is blocked. If the bool variable is true then thread is unblocked.

AutoResetEvent contains two main methods:

WaitOne() : Blocks the current thread
Set() : Unblock the current thread
Reset() : Sets the state of the event to non-signaled.
