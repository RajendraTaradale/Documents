Task and Task<T> :
Tasks are constructs used to implement what is known as the Promise Model of Concurrency. In short, they offer you a "promise" that work will be completed at a later point, letting you coordinate with the promise with a clean API.

Task represents a single operation which does not return a value.
Task<T> represents a single operation which returns a value of type T.

.NET provides us with two classes:

CancellationTokenSource – object responsible for creating cancellation token and sending cancellation request to all copies of that token.
CancellationToken – structure used by listeners to monitor token current state.
